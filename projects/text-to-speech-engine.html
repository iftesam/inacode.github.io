        <h1>Step-by-step instructions for making this webpage:</h1>
        <p>
          <br />
          <br />Here are the steps involved in scripting a webpage like this
          that allows users to convert text to speech:<br />
          <br /><br />
          <strong>1.</strong> First, you will need to set up the structure of
          the webpage using HTML. Open a new file in your text editor and begin
          the HTML document with the html element. Inside the html element, you
          should include the head element and the body element.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>2.</strong> The head element contains metadata about the
          webpage that is not displayed to the user. This can include the title
          of the webpage, which is displayed in the browser tab, as well as
          links to external resources such as stylesheets and scripts. Inside
          the head element, you should include a title element to give your
          webpage a title, and a style element to define the styles for your
          webpage using CSS.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>3.</strong> The body element contains the content of the
          webpage that will be displayed to the user. You can use various HTML
          elements such as div, h1, and textarea to create the layout and
          content of your webpage. A div element is a container element that can
          be used to group other elements together and apply styles to them. An
          h1 element is a heading element used to display large, bold text. A
          textarea element is an input field that allows the user to enter and
          edit multiple lines of text.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>4.</strong> To create buttons on your webpage, you can use the
          button element. You can customize the appearance of your buttons using
          CSS.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>5.</strong> To create a dropdown menu for selecting options on
          your webpage, you can use the select element and the option element.
          The select element creates a dropdown menu, and the option element is
          used to define the options that will be displayed in the menu.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>6.</strong> To add interactivity to your webpage, you have to
          use JavaScript. To use JavaScript, you will need to add a script
          element to your HTML document, either in the head element or the body
          element. Inside the script element, you can write JavaScript code to
          perform various actions such as processing user input, making requests
          to servers, and modifying the content of the webpage.<br /><br />
          <strong>7.</strong> The speechSynthesis object is part of the Web
          Speech API and is used to control the text-to-speech synthesis on your
          webpage. You can use the speechSynthesis.addEventListener function to
          set up an event listener that listens for the "voiceschanged" event,
          and runs a specified function when the event is triggered.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>8.</strong> The populateVoices function is used to populate
          the dropdown menu with the available voices for text-to-speech
          synthesis. This function uses the speechSynthesis.getVoices() method
          to get a list of available voices, and then it creates option elements
          for each voice and appends them to the select element.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>9.</strong> In addition to the "Speak" button, the webpage
          also includes a "Stop" button. This button allows the user to stop the
          text-to-speech synthesis if it is currently in progress. The "Stop"
          button is created using the button element and its appearance can be
          customized using CSS.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>10.</strong> The speechSynthesis.cancel() method cancels any
          ongoing utterances and clears the queue of any pending utterances.
          This ensures that the text-to-speech synthesis stops immediately when
          the "Stop" button is clicked. <br /><br />
          <strong>11.</strong> Once you have written your HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript code, save the file with a .html extension and open it in a
          web browser to view your webpage. You can continue to edit and refine
          your code as needed to create the desired functionality and design for
          your webpage.<br />
